# Machine Learning Models for Analyzing Bacterial Communities
This repository contains machine learning models designed to reveal the structure and function of bacterial communities in response to biochar application in farmland and forest soils.
## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to use machine learning models to analyze and interpret the impact of biochar on the bacterial community structure and functional attributes of soils. The models are applied to both farmland and forest soils, with the aim of uncovering patterns that may guide biochar applications for agricultural and environmental improvements.
## Features
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implementation of various machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, etc.) to predict bacterial community responses.
- **Visualization**: Includes code for visualizing data distributions, model performances, and feature importance.
- **Model Evaluation**: Methods to assess model accuracy and explainability.
